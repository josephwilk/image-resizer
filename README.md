#### (Drink to make small)

<img alt="Make smaller" src="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rgs/alice03a.gif" height="250px" /> <img alt="Drink to make small" src="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rgs/alice04a.gif" height="250px" />

## Why?

* Very fast (supports hardware accelerated operations on most platforms)
* No native libraries to install (I'm looking at you imagemagick)

Image Resizer under the hood wraps [imgscalr](https://github.com/thebuzzmedia/imgscalr).

##Installation

Add the following dependency to your project.clj file:

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/image-resizer/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/image-resizer)

## Usage

### Pipelining Transforms

Image resizer creates tranforms which return fns that apply that transform to an image.

A number of transforms are supported:

* resize
* crop
* pad
* rotate

If you want to perform a number of operations across an image (such as resize, crop, flip & pad):

```clojure
(require [image-resizer.crop :refer :all])
(require [image-resizer.resize :refer :all])
(require [image-resizer.pad :refer :all])
(require [image-resizer.rotate :refer :all])

(-> image
    ((resize-fn 100 100))
    ((crop-fn 100 100))
    ((rotate-vertically-fn))
    ((pad-fn 10)))


;Or if you want to apply a transform to a batch of images in parallel:

(doall (clojure.core/pmap (resize-fn 100 100) [image1 image2 image3 image4]))
```

### Tweaking quality/speed ratio

You can tweak your preferences for a resize transform. Favouring speed or quality:

```clojure
(require [image-resizer.resize :refer :all])
(require [image-resizer.scale-methods :refer :all])

(resize-fn 100 100 ultra-quality) ;best quality
(resize-fn 100 100 speed)         ;fast as possible resize
```

### Lazy helpers around transforms

If creating your own pipelines seems a bit funky, you can use some nice helpers for commmon operations:

```clojure
(require [image-resizer.core :refer :all])

;Resize an image while respecting original ratio
;Notice how the height is not 10 to respect the ratio of the image
(resize (file "white-rabbit.jpg") 10 10)          ; => #<BufferedImage width=10 height=4>

;Resize an image to a width
(resize-to-width (file "queen-of-hearts.jpg") 10) ; => #<BufferedImage width=10 height=4>

;Resize an image to a height
(resize-to-height (file "cheshire-cat.jpg") 10)   ; => #<BufferedImage width=5 height=10>

;Force width and a height resize (ignoring ratios)
(force-resize (file "cheshire-cat.jpg") 10 1000)   ; => #<BufferedImage width=10 height=1000>

;Crop the image width
(crop-to-width (file "tea-party/mad-hatter.jpg") 10) ; => #<BufferedImage width=10 height=1000>

;Crop the image height
(crop-to-height (file "tea-party/mad-hatter.jpg") 10) ; => #<BufferedImage width=1000 height=10>

;Crop the image width and height
(crop (file "tea-party/mad-hatter.jpg") 10 20) ; => #<BufferedImage width=10 height=20>

;Crop the image width and height from a coord
(crop-from (file "tea-party/mad-hatter.jpg") 6 7 10 20) ; => #<BufferedImage width=10 height=20>

;Resize the image maintaining proportions and then crop it to the specified width and height
(resize-and-crop (file "tea-party/mad-hatter.jpg") 10 10) ; => #<BufferedImage width=10 height=10>
```

### Turning BufferedImage into something useful

```Clojure
(require [image-resizer.format :as format])

;Saving as an auto-named file
(format/as-file
  (resize (file "tea-party/mad-hatter.jpg") 10 10)
  "/tmp/tea-party/mad-hatter.jpg") ; => "/tmp/tea-party/mad-hatter_10x5.jpg"

;Saving under a specific name
(format/as-file
  (resize (file "tea-party/mad-hatter.jpg") 10 10)
  "/tmp/tea-party/tiny-hatter.jpg"
  :verbatim) ; => "/tmp/tea-party/tiny-hatter.jpg"

;To a stream (Useful for s3)
(format/as-stream (resize (file "tea-party/mad-hatter.jpg") 10 10) "jpg") ; => #<ByteArrayInputStream>
```
